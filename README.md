## Sample and FFT data format
The data in `sample_data.mat` and `fft_data.mat` is stored in an array of structs with the following structure:

```
sample_data : Array (1 x # of people)
    [1] : Struct
        name : String
        data : double array (7, 240000)
    [2]
    [3]
    .
    .
    .
```
### Examples

Accessing the name of the third subject:
```MATLAB
sample_data(3).name
```

Accessing the sample data for the 5th sample from the third subject:
```MATLAB
sample_data(3).data(5, :)
```

Accessing the fft data for the 5th sample from the third subject:
```MATLAB
fft_data(3).data(5, :)
```

## Comparing scoring methods
You can use `compare_scores` to run the test samples for a single user against the system samples for every other user. The function returns a struct array with the following structure:

```
results : Array (1 x # of people)
    [1] : Struct
        name : String
        tests : Struct Array
            sample : number
            scores : Array
                [1] : number
                [2]
                [3]
                .
                .
                .
    [2]
    [3]
    .
    .
    .
```

Each element of `results` respresents a user in the system the method was tested against. Each element in `tests` respresents a test sample for the input user and each element of `scores` is the score for the test sample compared against a system sample for the current system user.

### Example
```MATLAB
results = compare_scores('Woodrow', 'compare_simple_diff');
```

### Visualizing
You can generate a plot of the scores generated by `compare_scores` using the `visualize_comparison` function like so:

```MATLAB
visualize_comparison('Woodrow', 'compare_simple_diff')
```
