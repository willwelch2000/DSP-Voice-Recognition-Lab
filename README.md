## Sample and FFT data format
The data in `system_data.mat` and `test_data.mat` is stored in an array of structs with the following structure:

```
system_data : Array (1 x # of people)
    [1] : Struct
        name    : String
        samples : double array (7, 240000)
        ffts    : double array (7, 120001)
    [2]
    [3]
    .
    .
    .
```
### Examples

Accessing the name of the third subject:
```MATLAB
system_data(3).name
```

Accessing the sample data for the 4th sample from the third subject:
```MATLAB
system_data(3).samples(4, :)
```

Accessing the fft data for the 4th sample from the third subject:
```MATLAB
system_data(3).ffts(4, :)
```

## Comparing scoring methods
You can use `compare_scores` to run the test samples for a single user against the system samples for every other user. The function returns a struct array with the following structure:

```
results : Array (1 x # of people)
    [1] : Struct
        name : String
        tests : Struct Array
            sample : number
            scores : Array
                [1] : number
                [2]
                [3]
                .
                .
                .
    [2]
    [3]
    .
    .
    .
```

Each element of `results` respresents a user in the system the method was tested against. Each element in `tests` respresents a test sample for the input user and each element of `scores` is the score for the test sample compared against a system sample for the current system user.

### Example
```MATLAB
results = compare_scores('Woodrow', 'compare_simple_diff');
```

### Visualizing
You can generate a plot of the scores generated by `compare_scores` using the `visualize_comparison` function like so:

```MATLAB
visualize_comparison('Woodrow', 'compare_simple_diff')
```

## Finding top results
You can use `top_results` to find the top ten matches of a given test subject and sample number, either 1 or 2.
The return value is two separate arrays, one showing the names of the subjects corresponding to the top ten matches, and the other with the scores of those matches. 

## Finding prediction of a single test sample
To find the prediction (system's choice for a match) of a specific sample, use the `prediction` function. 

### Example
```MATLAB
choice = prediction("Will", 1);
```
Finds the system choice for a match for Will's first test sample.
